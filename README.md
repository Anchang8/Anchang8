I am currently a 4-th year undergraduated student in [ICVSLab]("http://pogary.yu.ac.kr/notice.html") at Yeungnam University. And my major is Electronic Engineering. 

My research interests include computer vision and deep learning, particulary in generative models(ex. Generative Adversarial Network).
